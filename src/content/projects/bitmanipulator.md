# INTRODUCTION

This project was developed as part of an assignment during IOT classes in Facens: 1st semester of Computer Engineering. The assignment requested for the student to develop any project using an Arduino and an IR remote using the tinkercad interface. The project at hand aims to recreate bitwise operations present in standard programming languages, such as Left-Shift, Right-Shift, OR, AND. Also allows saving and loading bit states in memory.
