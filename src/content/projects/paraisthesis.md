# INTRODUCTION

Paraisthesis is a singleplayer horror game where you play as a Technician investigating a mysterious crater created by the meltdown of the Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor. You must discover the creature lying dormant below several layers of irradiated soil and concrete.
- The game is developed as a team of 5 Computer Engineering students at FACENS.

# GAMEPLAY

While exploring the underground, you must fend off against monsters with the aid of a radar: a device that contains a measurement of distance between you and the monster. The monster is attracted by sound, so you must manage your distance from it before solving any of the game's puzzles.
