# INTRODUCTION

"Maia Jr" is a category of automated miniature vehicle made created by the MAIA team. It is well regarded for its simplicity and use as a learning tool for new developers and hardware enthusiasts alike. 

# FEATURES

The vehicle contains the following:
- (1x-3x) ultrassonic sensors;
- (1x) Arduino board;
- (2x) Motors;
- (1x) 5-12V CC Motor controller (M298N module);
- (1x) 5V mobile rechargeable battery;
- (1x) Battery charger regulator port (USB-C);
- (1x) Chassis
- (2x) mountable rubber wheels

# FUNCTIONALITY

The vehicle is designed to avoid obstacles in real time by using the distance variation between ultrassonic sensor readings. The positioning of these sensors is crucial. For 3 sensors, one must be placed forwards from the center, followed by two additional sensors on both sides, rotated about 30° clockwise and counter-clockwise. If an object approaches the sensors, the vehicle will rotate accordingly until it finds a clear view to continue moving forwards.

# RELEVANCE

The project is relevant for the following reasons:
- Allows the student to learn the functionality of Arduino, applications and how it interfaces with external input.
- Encourages problem-solving skills by developing a solid firmware capable of utilizing sensor feedback to the best extent.
- Introduces the student to hardware and electronics.
