# INTRODUCTION

A Website created in HTML/CSS/Javascript and Bootstrap as part of a Computer Engineering assignment (2nd semester, Facens). The goal being the development of a basic website that uses Javascript behavior, DOM structure and custom styles. The group chose to develop a music playback website inspired by Spotify.

# RELEVANCY

The project displays the use of modern web development tools such as HTML5 and Boostrap, tested with popular libraries such as Express.js.

# RESULTS

The project functioned as espected. The objective was to allow the user to search and playback songs. We planned to also implement a profile and customization page, scrapped features due to time constraints. The current form, however, provided the group a solid introduction to web development and the code is freely available for any beginners alike.

- **Note: The page is ONLY available on portuguese. No translations have been made. Moreover, the songs used are directly accessible within the repository itself. A practice done solely due to time constraints. The solution is innapropriate and is not recommended.**
