# INTRODUCTION

The main goal of the project was to develop a system capable of storing and refrigerating vaccines and other medical equipment at acceptable temperatures, powered by solar energy, when being carried to places where availability of electricity is uncertain. 

# RELEVANCY

This project becomes relevant when tackling the need to provide vaccines and medication in areas where power is not readily available, especially in countries ridden with poverty.

# THE SOLUTION

The proposed solution is to implement a portable refrigerator using a pelcier system, inside a heat-blocking compartment (polypropylene), powered by a solar panel.

# RESULTS

Despite interesting results (the inside of the compartment was able to reach temperatures as low as 2°C), the project was deemed unfeasible by the group due to high energy consumption to cooling intensity ratio provided by the Pelcier system.
