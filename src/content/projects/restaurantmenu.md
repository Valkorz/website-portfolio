# INTRODUCTION

A Website created in HTML/CSS/Javascript as part of a Computer Engineering assignment (2nd semester, Facens). The goal being the development of a basic website that uses Javascript behavior, DOM structure and custom styles. The group chose to develop a menu page for a restaurant.

# RELEVANCY

As the world shifts away from analog and paper-based menus, the group found great relevancy in developing a web-based menu, as many restaurants are currently implementing online menus (accessed through a link or QR Code). 

# RESULTS

The project functioned as espected. The objective was to allow the user to inspect the menu, select dishes and calculate the final price. We planned to also implement a checkout page, a scrapped feature due to time constraints. The current form, however, provided the group a solid introduction to web development and the code is freely available for any beginners alike.
